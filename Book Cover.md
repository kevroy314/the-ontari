A book cover for a fantasy book of lore detailing the stories of a pantheon of gods of balance and life known as The Ontari. The title of the book should be in a gold, not overly ornate font and say "The Ontari". There should be a primary but small/understated central logo that is a hexagon that is twice as wide as it is tall with lines coming out of the corners at 60 degree angles and from the horizontal and vertical centerlines. The lines should fade at the tips slowly over a distance approximately the size of the vertical height. The book cover should have a mysterious and understated vibe, like a hidden treasure being discovered whose secrets speak for themselves without the need for a flashy presentation. There should also be an aged, weathered texture cast to everything.

Edit: The book cover should be compatible with a 9x7 book and be fully
