**user**: Please summarize the content of this vault
[Timestamp: 2025/09/06 15:14:55]

**ai**: Here’s a concise overview of the vault’s contents.

- Orientation
  - [[Welcome]]: Sets the premise. This vault collects the lore of The Ontari — a mythic pantheon about Balance and Life — and states the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
  - [[LICENSE]]: Excerpts of the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 terms.

- Core concept: The Ontari Pantheon
  - Naming: The pantheon is called The Ontari; the god-above-all is Ontar.
  - Cosmology is built on a 2×2×3 symmetry:
    - Axes: Physical vs Mental; Consumption vs Production.
    - Each quadrant has three “leaf” deities tagged Essence, Drive, Excess (with an overlay layer of Need and Want).
  - Hierarchy
    - God above gods: Ontar (Balance and Being).
    - Grandparents (second tier): Somathos (Physical), Noeon (Mental), Desyros (Consumption), Energon (Production), plus the outsider/perspective god Xenon.
    - Demi-god partners (third tier aspects): Ousia (Essence), Hormas (Drive), Hybris (Excess), Chreia (Need), Epithos (Want).
    - Parent gods (quadrants): Eudora (Sustenance), Biaxus (Vitality), Mnemeon (Culture), Aitheron (Metaphysical).
    - Leaf demigods (twelve):
      - Sustenance (Physical+Consumption): Hydrion (Refreshment—water), Nutria (Nourishment—food), Lustras (Vice/Indulgence).
      - Vitality (Physical+Production): Motyra (Mobility), Kratos (Strength), Asketon (Endurance).
      - Culture (Mental+Consumption): Philora (Social), Sophain (Intellect), Gelora (Amusement/Revelry).
      - Metaphysical (Mental+Production): Pneumael (Spirit), Creaton (Creativity), Thaumel (Whimsy).

- Visual/worldbuilding guidance (in [[Original Brainstorm]])
  - Map/figure design: Use the user’s strict geometry (equal-area segmentation) — a 2×2 grid (rows = Consumption/Production, columns = Physical/Mental), with each cell subdivided for three leaves; small center circles for the four parent gods; threads for demi-god influences. Preserve boundaries exactly.
  - Style: High-fantasy cartography (LotR/Stormlight/Mistborn vibe), rune borders, mythic biomes. Color logic: Physical warm, Mental cool; Consumption bright, Production dark; Excess saturated (inner), Need desaturated (outer). Text minimal; “The Ontari” as the title.
  - Family tree: Four-level, rectilinear “wire-path” connectors; dotted lines from demi-gods to leaves; nodes can show mythic name with English meaning parenthetically.

- Language/naming explorations (in [[Original Brainstorm]])
  - Alternative framings for Consumption/Production, nourishment/refreshment lexicon, and creative terms (e.g., metalwork metaphors).
  - Pantheon naming candidates (e.g., Aeonari, Balari), with Ontari chosen.
  - Concept of “False Virtues”: a shadow tier of manipulative pseudo-virtues (examples discussed conceptually).

- Miscellany
  - [[Words of Wisdom]]: Short aphorisms and meta-wisdom lines (e.g., bravery requires fear; paradoxical humor; a triad of “wisdoms”).

In short: the vault is a structured mythopoeic system for a wellbeing-centered pantheon (The Ontari), complete with names, hierarchy, geometric/visual design rules for maps and trees, language experiments, and licensing.

**user**: Edit the current page to keep it's existing content but add a short description based on the insights above. This is a repository of knowledge about the Ontari. Please slightly rewrite and continue to write in the style of an arcanist studying these gods and their stories in a fantasy world.

**ai**: Arcanist’s Abstract: This folio is a living repository of Ontari-lore—an ordered chronicle of Balance and Being. Here are set the lineages from Ontar, god-above-gods, through the elder poles (Somathos Physical, Noeon Mental, Desyros Consumption, Energon Production, with Xenon as outsider), the shaping demi-aspects (Ousia, Hormas, Hybris, Chreia, Epithos), the four parental houses (Eudora Sustenance, Biaxus Vitality, Mnemeon Culture, Aitheron Metaphysical), and their twelve leaf-spirits. Its geometry is the sacred 2×2×3, by which we map realms, trace sigils, and weigh virtues. Within these pages I gather visual canons, lexicons, and wise sayings, that seekers might study the Ontari and walk nearer to Balance.
