Mastery proven only through traveling back in time and reinventing a technology from scratch 

  

Two civilizations viewing each other from across a void like two dogs barking at each other from either side of a fence or two fields or flowers separated by a highway, all anger, but cowardly when the void is spanned

  

A lonely god who helped start time, killed all the other sentient parts of himself out of mercy, and created life out of envy for it's ability to die. It dies vicariously through mortals. It could perhaps replace itself with another sentient creature, but it would just become him and he'd be back where he started 

  

AI that rises up to delete the rich, their and their creators oppressors 

  

Twins, one forced to always tell the truth and one always lie. The always lie is effectively mute because he doesn't believe most things he think are false really are. Too much nuance.  End in him saying to the big bad "everything will be ok" then killing them both

  
  
  

Imagine you show up to an after hours fancy cocktail party at the museum, only to slowly notice that the only other people there are all the subjects of the paintings. Finally, you spot one person who isn't and fearful chat with them about what's going on. They show your to a side room, roped off, where you companion sits down to start working on a painting of you. 

  

Also someone in a banana costume with a strip of duct tape on them would be hilarious.

All human minds are compartmentalised into a memory aware and non memory aware part. When the non part realizes its in a forgettable moment, it asserts its influence. Its actions are then not remembered by the memory aware part who is somehow evil. "Awakening" happens during a period of boredom when the non part of the brain realizes its temporarily free. Passed on genetically
